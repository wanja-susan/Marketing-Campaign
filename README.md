# **Project Overview**
Marketing Campaign Analysis is a data-driven Power BI dashboard project developed to evaluate the impact of a targeted campaign promoting QuickSave, a key feature in the Ziwatech fintech app. QuickSave empowers users, students, gig workers, small business owners, and everyday savers, to build consistent savings habits through automated micro-savings, goal-based plans, and behavioral nudges.

The goal of this campaign was to:

- Increase awareness and adoption of the QuickSave feature

- Boost engagement through email, app, web, and social campaigns

- Drive improvements in saving behavior, user retention, and ROI

The campaign was structured in three phases; Before, During, and After, with each phase offering a unique lens into user activity, channel performance, and campaign effectiveness. This analysis helps the Ziwatech team understand what worked, what didn’t, and how to continuously improve future outreach efforts.

Ultimately, this project supports Ziwatech’s mission: to change the narrative around saving, proving that you don’t need to “save big” to get started. With QuickSave, every small step counts.

# **Data Sources**

This project is based on simulated campaign data collected during the QuickSave promotional campaign conducted by Ziwatech. The data was modeled to reflect a real-world, multi-channel campaign across mobile, web, email, and social platforms.

Data Types Used:

**User & Engagement Data**

- Total users, platform usage (web, app, social)

- Device types (desktop, mobile)

- Bounce rate and session duration

- Email subscription rate and wishlist usage

- Demographic segments (age group, gender, location)

**Marketing Campaign Metrics**

- Ad impressions and clicks

- Click-through rate (CTR), cost-per-click (CPC)

- Channel-level performance (App, Email, Social, Web)

- Daily campaign activities: email opens, spend, clicks

**Sales & Outcome Metrics**

- Conversion rate and acquisition cost

- Revenue and average order value

- Return on Investment (ROI) over time

- Retention metrics by channel and region

Assumptions and Constraints:

- Timeframe: The campaign ran from October 2024 to January 2025, segmented into three distinct phases for analysis.

- All figures (e.g., clicks, spend, revenue) are illustrative and anonymized for confidentiality.

- User segmentation (e.g., Loyal, Infrequent, Deal Seekers) was predefined using behavioral scoring.

- Revenue data reflects savings behavior (e.g., goal completions, deposit activity) rather than traditional e-commerce transactions.

- Engagement is tracked per channel and region (6 U.S. states), assuming consistent campaign delivery and tracking infrastructure.

This dataset provides a strong foundation for evaluating campaign impact and making informed strategic decisions for future marketing initiatives.

# **Methodology and Analysis Phases**

The analysis follows a structured approach across three distinct phases; Before, During, and After the campaign. Each phase serves a specific purpose in evaluating the effectiveness and ROI of the QuickSave promotional efforts.

**Before the Campaign**

The pre-campaign analysis focused on establishing performance baselines and setting realistic campaign targets. This included:

- Reviewing historical data on user activity, channel engagement, and goal conversion rates.

- Segmenting users by behavior (Loyal, Infrequent, Deal Seekers) and region (6 U.S. states).

- Identifying underperforming channels and regions to prioritize for improvement.

- Setting KPIs for adoption rate, click-through rate (CTR), and conversion uplift.

- Benchmarking bounce rate, revenue, and retention across platforms.

This groundwork provided a clear view of where the campaign needed to have the most impact and informed strategy alignment with product goals.

**During the Campaign**

During the active campaign period, real-time performance was monitored to assess traction and guide tactical adjustments. This phase included:

- Tracking key marketing KPIs: clicks, impressions, CTR, cost-per-click (CPC), email opens.

- Monitoring engagement across channels (App, Web, Email, Social).

- Visualizing trends in bounce rate, wishlist activity, and platform usage.

- Comparing performance by region and device type to refine targeting.

- Utilizing Power BI dashboards to enable near real-time insights for decision-makers.

The campaign was continuously optimized using these insights to maximize reach and ROI while staying agile in execution.

**After the Campaign**

Post-campaign analysis focused on evaluating outcomes against initial goals and drawing insights for future strategy. This included:

- Measuring increases in user acquisition, retention, and QuickSave goal completions.

- Analyzing revenue growth, conversion rates, and ROI by channel and region.

- Assessing performance variance between user segments and platforms.

- Identifying high-performing campaign components and underperforming areas.

- Summarizing findings into actionable recommendations for future campaigns.

The after-campaign evaluation not only demonstrated campaign impact but also generated strategic insights to guide long-term marketing planning.
